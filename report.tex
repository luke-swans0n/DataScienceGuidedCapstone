\title{Modelling Big Mountain Resort Pricing}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Key Findings}
According to our model, Big Mountain Resort is currently undercharging for adult weekend tickets. Our model suggests a new price of \$95.88 (MAE: \$10.36). The variables with the most affect on pricing were: vertical drop, snow making area, total number of chairs, fast quads, quantity of runs, length of longest run, trams, and skiiable area. Of these variables, except trams, Big Mountain was above its competition.
